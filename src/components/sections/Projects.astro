      dates="Mar 2022 - Present"
      tech={["Rust", "Lua"]}
      link="https://github.com/PY44N/LuaObfuscatorV2"
    >
      I wrote a program that obfuscates Lua code. It allows you to release
      programs coded in Lua without distributing the source code. It can be used
      for Roblox games or any general purpose Lua applications.

    >
      As programming lead and team captain, I helped to design and program an
      FRC robot complete with swerve drive, full odometry, dynamic autonomous
      modes, command-based inverse kinematics, and dynamic trajectory
      calculations that allowed the robot to shoot from anywhere. This robot won
      awards for its code at the local Long Island Regional and for its
      innovative bumper design at the world championships in Houston, Texas.

      tech={["Rust", "Lua"]}
      link="https://github.com/PY44N/LuaDeserializer"
    >
      I created a program that takes in Lua code, complies it, and deserializes
      the compiled output. This allows you to work with the internal structures
      of the Lua language, and can be used to view the compiled output or to
      build an obfuscator on top of the language. Used in my <a
        href="https://github.com/PY44N/LuaObfuscatorV2">Lua Obfuscator</a
      >.

    >
      I developed this website using Astro and Less, creating a fully responsive
      design and implementing SEO best practices for improved visibility on
      search engines.

      name="Safe Water Operation"
      dates="Sep 2023 - Apr 2024"
      tech={["React", "Javascript", "Leaflet"]}
    >
      As part of a small group, I developed an app to make water quality data
      easily accessible to everyone. The app shows data from the United States
      Geological Survey on a map to make it easy to tell the water quality in
      your area. This app won the congressional app challenge for NY01 and was
      presented to congress at the house of code event in April 2024.

      name="Oxygen Tanks"

      tech={["Flutter", "Dart", "Svelte", "Javascript"]}
    >
      As part of my work in the 3D Design and Innovation Lab at Northwell
      Health, I created a Flutter app to track the oxygen levels in patient
      transport tanks and send push notifications to alert the relavant hospital
      staff if any of the tanks are running low. This app is currently being
      evaluated for use across the healthcare system

      dates="May 2022 - Jan 2024"
      tech={["Kotlin", "Gradle", "Dokka", "JUnit"]}
    >
      I created a library for programming FRC robots with a customizable swerve
      drive, swerve autonomous utilities, limelight utilities, and math classes
      for vectors and bezier curves. It's fully documented with Dokka and has
      full unit testing with JUnit, making it easy to use and reliable during
      competitions.

      tech={["Kotlin", "Gradle", "JUnit"]}
      link="https://github.com/CshCyberhawks/GoodNewsGoose"
    >
      As programming lead, I programmed a robot for the FIRST Robotics
      Competition that had swerve drive, full odometry, dynamic autonomous mode,
      and a PID controlled arm. This allowed it to compete at the highest
      levels, earning it a spot in the world championships in Houston, Texas.

    >
      As programming lead, I coded an FRC robot with a custom swerve drive
      train, field orientation, PID controllers, full odometry, and a dynamic
      autonomous mode. These advanced features provide precise control, accurate
      tracking, and customizable movements for a strategic advantage during
      competitions.
